## Summary

I am an avid Python developer with a true passion for its flexibility and performance. I have a deep interest in large data problems. I was previously engaged in the Autonomous Driving space and have worked on data capture related problems in the mapping space. Previously, I was involved with software efforts around crowd-sourced mapping and have developed data warehousing platforms in ad tech. I've had the great opportunity to work on interesting problems with great people. I have held a variety of hats throughout my career and am at home in the midst of complicated technical problems. I am now an ex-scientist leaving my PhD for the chance to explore computational problems in industry.  
**Specialties:** Mapping, API development, Distributed Computing, Databases, Virtualization, Computer Simulations, Python, Cluster management, Data Analysis.
